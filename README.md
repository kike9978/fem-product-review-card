## My process

### Built with

- Figma design tools
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I've been trying to understand the way flexbox works and how it centers the elements vertically, I would like to be abble to center the contents without the content overflowing.
Also would like to discover how to round the borders of an img with a div with already rounded borders without rounding the borders of the img with brute force.
